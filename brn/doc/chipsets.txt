This page was created to address the lack of easily obtainable information about Atheros chipsets. It may not be entirely correct, but was taken from information on [http://www.atheros.com Atheros'] site.
NOTE: this is '''not''' a list of supported chipsets. The list of supported chipsets can be found on the [wiki:About/OpenHAL OpenHAL] page. USB dongles are not supported, and will probably not be supported in the near future.

A list of Atheros' partners along with their products and chipsets can be found on the [http://customerproducts.atheros.com/customerproducts/ Atheros] web site.  The list seems to be missing some of the very latest products but serves as a handy reference for comparing products between manufacturers.
